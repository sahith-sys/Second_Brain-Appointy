# Extension Icons Needed

To complete the extension installation, you need to add 3 icon files to this folder:

## Required Files:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Quick Solutions:

### Option 1: Use a Placeholder Generator
Visit: https://placehold.co/128x128/667eea/white?text=S&font=roboto
- Replace the sizes (128, 48, 16) in the URL
- Right-click and "Save image as..."
- Name them accordingly

### Option 2: Create Simple Icons
Use any image editor (Paint, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.):
1. Create a square canvas (128x128, 48x48, 16x16)
2. Fill with a purple background (#667eea)
3. Add a white "S" in the center
4. Save as PNG

### Option 3: Use Free Icon Resources
- https://www.flaticon.com/ (search for "brain" or "synapse")
- https://icons8.com/ (search for "brain")
- Make sure to download in PNG format at the required sizes

### Option 4: Use Online Icon Generator
1. Go to: https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Create a simple "S" favicon
3. Download the generated files
4. Rename them to match our requirements

## Temporary Workaround:
If you just want to test the extension quickly:
- Find ANY .png image on your computer
- Copy it 3 times into this folder
- Rename to: icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
- The extension will work (just won't look pretty)

Once you add the icons, reload the extension in Chrome!
